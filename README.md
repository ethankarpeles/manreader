# Manreader
A php program that's designed to view manuscripts.

## What is Manreader?

Manuscripts often have messy handwriting, and can be difficult to read. 
The purpose of this program is to provide a seamless method for the end-user to view more legible versions of manuscripts,
while allowing them to see which words of these manuscripts with increased legibility correspond to which words of the original
manuscripts.

The largest advantage of Manreader is that it can easily be scaled up to include many manuscripts as you want,
while having each of these manuscripts include as many pages as you want.

While this program was designed for manuscripts, it can also be used in any situation where you have multiple pairs of 
equally sized png and jpg images that you would like to compare with eachother by overlaying the png image on top of the jpg
image.
